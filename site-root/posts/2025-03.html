    <h1>2025-03 - Hydra and Strudel</h1><br>
        Have spent a bunch of time this month on Nudel, Strudel, and Hydra. <br>
        Reading docs, playing around, having a good time. <br>
        Inspired, obviously, by algorave/jams I've been going to and joining in a little bit at. <br>
        Gonna write my own personal cheat sheet for each tool, since wading through the docs is too slow at the moment!<br>
