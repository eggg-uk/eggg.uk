    <h1>Second Post</h1><br>
    Howdy, Another post probably due. <br>
    It's the 8th of November, in the evening. 
    Made a very basic thing which I'll probably immediately be embarrassed about how basic it is.<br>
    Context being, I 3D modelled some tumour size measurements for someone a while back, it was shown to clinical staff, they liked it. <br>
    <a href="/3d/">So I suggested I might be able to make something simple to help others. The result is hosted here.</a> <br>
    It's not "finished" by any stretch of the imagination, and I am contactible if you are keen for me to go further<br>
    <i>just steer me on what would be useful and I'll try to figure it out.</i><br>
