    Howdy, Me again. <br>
    It's the 10th of Feb 2025, in the afternoon. I've just jumped off a work call and need a minute. Figure ahead of this evening (maybe teaching very basic html) i'd pop something up. <br>
    
    I'm using something called p5js while reading a book on creative coding. It's a js library which allows you to visually create things with your code. <br>
