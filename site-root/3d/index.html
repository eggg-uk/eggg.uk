    Enter dimensions (mm/cm/doesn't matter, just be consistent) for three dimensions, and hit "add sphere". <br>
    Models will appear in a line. If you refresh the page things will reset.<br>
    Models are always a spheroid which is stretched to match the x,y,z coordinates given. Obviously it won't be perfectly accurate but should give an idea of scale I hope.<br>
        You can rotate the camera with left mouse, move it with right, and zoom with middle.<br><br>
