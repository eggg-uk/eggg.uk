worked some of today trying to move my existing posts (which were not publicised) from hand crafted html, into markdown format for site generation. 

Purpose is to ensure that I have automatic links between posts, tags and other useful features while keeping things reasonably lean

picked [bearcub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub) theme because it looks nice and simple to work with and auto creates RSS feed

probably gonna aim to do the github actions thing, which is reasonably new to me too
