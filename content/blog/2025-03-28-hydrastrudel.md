Have spent a bunch of time this month on Nudel, Strudel, and Hydra.

Reading docs, playing around, having a good time.

Inspired, obviously, by algorave/jams I've been going to and joining in a little bit at.

Gonna write my own personal cheat sheet for each tool, since wading through the docs is sometimes a bit slow at the moment!
