Been following (lagging behind) along the [london creative coding book club](https://creativecodingbook.club/) - not had the chance to join an event yet but it's on my list!

 Here's a brief script I've built as part of an excercise from [Nature of code](https://natureofcode.com/random/)'s ch0 - Randomness 

very cool so far. 

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.11.1/p5.js"></script>
<script>

function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth/3, windowHeight/2);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed === true) {
    fill(random(255/2,255));
  } else {
    fill(random(0,255/2))
  }

  circle(mouseX,mouseY,100)
}
</script>
