While on hol in Korea earlier this year (April), I created a test page with some timezones to replace widgets I used to have on my phone.

should be accessible [here](https://eggg.uk/time)

it highlights the zone you're in (if applicable) and uses some reasonably straight forward js/html 

I could probably drive the js file further in the future

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/eggg-uk/eggg.uk/tree/main/content/time)
